Dear Development Team,

I'm writing to share the key findings from our recent user research sessions on Personal Data Vault privacy concerns. These insights should inform our implementation priorities.

Key Findings:

1. **Data Ownership Clarity**: 87% of participants want clear visual indicators showing what data they own vs. what's shared. They need granular control over data visibility.

2. **Encryption Transparency**: Users want to understand when their data is encrypted, with whom it's shared, and what level of access each party has. The "sealed envelope" metaphor resonates strongly.

3. **Offline Capability**: 92% of users expressed concern about data availability when offline. They want assurance that critical personal data remains accessible without internet connectivity.

4. **Social Graph Privacy**: There's significant anxiety about social connections being exposed. Users want to control which relationships are visible to different applications and contexts.

5. **Attention Economy Concerns**: While users are interested in earning BLOOM tokens, they're concerned about privacy implications of attention tracking. They want opt-in mechanisms with clear data usage policies.

Recommendations:

- Implement visual privacy indicators in the Navigator interface
- Add detailed encryption status displays in the Vault
- Ensure offline-first architecture for core personal data
- Design granular permission systems for social graph access
- Create transparent attention tracking with user consent flows

The research data is available in our shared workspace under "User Research > Personal Data Vaults > January 2024".
