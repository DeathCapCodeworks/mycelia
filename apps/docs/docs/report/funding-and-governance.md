Treasury
The project is backed by a treasury of $20,000,000,000 (Twenty Billion USD), secured entirely through cash donations. This capital underwrites operations, collateralizes the treasury, and guarantees long term financial sovereignty and stability.

Runway and reserves
Assume multi year runway with risk reserves for audits and incident response.

Reserves attestations and SPV roadmap
The BLOOM token maintains a hard peg of 10 BLOOM = 1 BTC, backed by locked Bitcoin reserves. The Proof of Reserves system provides verifiable evidence of collateralization through:

- **SPV Verification**: Simplified Payment Verification of Bitcoin UTXOs
- **Reserve Attestations**: Regular third-party audits of locked reserves
- **Transparent Reporting**: Public reserve statements and verification
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Static reserve feeds for demo and testing

The SPV roadmap includes:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic UTXO monitoring (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Full SPV verification with Merkle proofs
3. **Phase 3**: Multi-signature reserve management
4. **Phase 4**: Decentralized reserve verification

See [Proof of Reserves](/tokenomics/proof-of-reserves) for detailed specifications.

Governance
High level governance model with technical steering, risk, and treasury oversight.
