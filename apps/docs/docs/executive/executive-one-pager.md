Project Mycelia rests on three pillars, a high performance Layer 1, the BLOOM token with core applications, and the Mycelia Navigator Web4 browser. Funding is twenty billion dollars in cash donations. The goal is to attract top talent and deliver a multi year roadmap.

Pillars
- The chain provides scale, security, and decentralization.
- BLOOM powers the network through Proof of Contribution.
- The Navigator integrates Web2, Web3, and Web4 primitives.

New features
- Mycelia Oracle, on device agent over the personal data vault.
- Context Aware Workspaces, rule based layouts.
- BLOOM Rewards, privacy safe local decisioning.
- Portable Social Graph, DID anchored contacts with scoped access.
- Bitcoin Testnet Redemption, HTLC-based BLOOM to BTC exchange.
- Proof of Reserves, SPV verification of locked Bitcoin collateral.
- Staking Preview, validator and delegation mechanics.

BLOOM Token Peg
The BLOOM token is fixed at a hard peg of 10 BLOOM = 1 BTC. Each BLOOM is fully redeemable for BTC at the fixed rate, backed by locked Bitcoin reserves. Minting halts automatically if reserves would fall below full collateral.

See [Redemption on Bitcoin Testnet](/tokenomics/redemption-bitcoin-testnet), [Proof of Reserves](/tokenomics/proof-of-reserves), and [Staking Preview](/tokenomics/staking-preview) for detailed specifications.

Funding statement
The project is backed by a treasury of $20,000,000,000, secured entirely through cash donations. This capital underwrites operations, collateralizes the treasury, and guarantees long term financial sovereignty and stability.
