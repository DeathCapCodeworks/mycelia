# Session Time Machine

The Session Time Machine is a powerful feature that allows users to save, restore, and manage workspace sessions across time. It provides a seamless way to preserve your work state and return to previous configurations.

## What is the Session Time Machine?

The Session Time Machine captures the complete state of your workspace at any point in time, including:

- **Open Tabs**: All currently open tabs and their content
- **Scroll Positions**: Exact scroll position for each tab
- **Form States**: Current values in forms (with privacy protection)
- **Wallet Context**: Connected wallet state (without sensitive data)
- **UI State**: Panel positions, collapsed/expanded states
- **Navigation History**: Recent navigation and browsing history

## Key Features

### Instant Snapshots
- **One-Click Save**: Save your current workspace state instantly
- **Named Snapshots**: Give meaningful names to your snapshots
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Each snapshot includes creation time
- **Quick Access**: Access recent snapshots from the sidebar

### Smart Restoration
- **Selective Restore**: Choose which aspects to restore
- **Incremental Updates**: Only restore what has changed
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts when restoring over active sessions
- **Rollback Safety**: Easy rollback if restoration causes issues

### Privacy Protection
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Automatically remove sensitive information
- **Form State Sanitization**: Clean form data before saving
- **Wallet Privacy**: Never save private keys or sensitive wallet data
- **User Control**: Users decide what gets saved

## How It Works

### Snapshot Creation

When you create a snapshot, the Time Machine:

1. **Captures Tab State**: Records all open tabs and their URLs
2. **Saves Scroll Positions**: Records exact scroll position for each tab
3. **Preserves Form Data**: Saves form values (with privacy filtering)
4. **Records UI State**: Captures panel positions and UI preferences
5. **Stores Wallet Context**: Saves wallet connection state (public data only)
6. **Creates Index**: Builds a searchable index of the snapshot
7. **Encrypts Data**: Securely stores the snapshot in your vault

### Snapshot Storage

Snapshots are stored using content-addressed storage:

```typescript
interface SessionSnapshot {
  id: string;                    // Unique snapshot ID
  name: string;                  // User-defined name
  timestamp: number;            // Creation timestamp
  tabs: TabState[];             // Open tabs and their state
  scrollPositions: Map<string, number>; // Scroll positions by tab ID
  formStates: Map<string, any>; // Form states (sanitized)
  walletContext: WalletState;   // Wallet connection state
  uiState: UIState;             // UI panel positions and preferences
}
```

### Restoration Process

When restoring a snapshot:

1. **Validate Snapshot**: Ensure the snapshot is valid and accessible
2. **Backup Current State**: Save current state as a backup
3. **Restore Tabs**: Reopen tabs and navigate to saved URLs
4. **Restore Scroll**: Set scroll positions for each tab
5. **Restore Forms**: Populate forms with saved data
6. **Restore UI**: Restore panel positions and UI preferences
7. **Restore Wallet**: Reconnect to previously connected wallets
8. **Update Index**: Update the snapshot index

## Using the Time Machine

### Creating Snapshots

1. **Navigate to Time Machine**: Go to `/time-machine` in the sandbox
2. **Click "Save Snapshot"**: Create a new snapshot of current state
3. **Name Your Snapshot**: Give it a meaningful name
4. **Confirm Save**: Review what will be saved and confirm

### Managing Snapshots

The Time Machine dashboard shows:

- **Snapshot List**: All your saved snapshots
- **Search**: Find snapshots by name or content
- **Preview**: See what's in each snapshot before restoring
- **Metadata**: Creation time, size, and content summary
- **Actions**: Restore, rename, delete, or export snapshots

### Restoring Snapshots

1. **Select Snapshot**: Choose the snapshot you want to restore
2. **Preview Changes**: See what will be restored
3. **Choose Options**: Select which aspects to restore
4. **Confirm Restore**: Execute the restoration
5. **Verify Results**: Check that everything restored correctly

## Advanced Features

### Snapshot Indexing

The Time Machine creates a searchable index of all snapshots:

- **Content Search**: Find snapshots containing specific content
- **Tag System**: Add tags to organize snapshots
- **Date Filtering**: Filter snapshots by creation date
- **Size Sorting**: Sort by snapshot size or complexity

### Automatic Snapshots

Configure automatic snapshots for:

- **Periodic Saves**: Save workspace state every N minutes
- **Before Actions**: Save before major operations
- **On Exit**: Automatically save when closing workspace
- **On Changes**: Save when significant changes occur

### Snapshot Sharing

Share snapshots with others:

- **Export Snapshots**: Download snapshot data
- **Import Snapshots**: Load snapshots from files
- **Snapshot Links**: Generate shareable links (with permissions)
- **Collaborative Workspaces**: Share snapshots in team environments

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All snapshots are encrypted before storage
- **Access Control**: Only you can access your snapshots
- **Sensitive Data**: Private keys and passwords are never saved
- **Audit Trail**: Track who accessed what snapshots when

### Privacy Settings

Configure what gets saved:

- **Include Forms**: Choose whether to save form data
- **Include Wallet**: Decide if wallet state should be saved
- **Include History**: Control if navigation history is saved
- **Data Retention**: Set how long snapshots are kept

## Integration with Mycelia

### Workspaces Engine

The Time Machine integrates deeply with the Workspaces Engine:

```typescript
// Save snapshot when workspace is deactivated
workspace.onExit(async () => {
  await saveSnapshot('auto-save', {
    tabs: workspace.getActiveTabs(),
    scrollPositions: workspace.getScrollPositions(),
    formStates: workspace.getFormStates(),
    walletContext: workspace.getWalletContext()
  });
});
```

### Vault Integration

Snapshots are stored in your personal vault:

- **Encrypted Storage**: All data encrypted with your keys
- **Version Control**: Track changes to snapshots over time
- **Backup Sync**: Snapshots sync across your devices
- **Storage Management**: Monitor and manage snapshot storage usage

### Oracle Integration

The Oracle can help with snapshot management:

- **Smart Naming**: Suggest meaningful names for snapshots
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze snapshot content for insights
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and merge similar snapshots
- **Optimization**: Suggest ways to optimize snapshot storage

## Best Practices

### Snapshot Management

1. **Regular Saves**: Create snapshots before major changes
2. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for easy identification
3. **Clean Up**: Periodically delete old or unnecessary snapshots
4. **Test Restores**: Occasionally test restoring snapshots to ensure they work
5. **Backup Important**: Export important snapshots as files

### Privacy Considerations

1. **Review Content**: Check what's being saved before creating snapshots
2. **Sensitive Data**: Be aware that some data might be captured
3. **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access snapshots
4. **Data Retention**: Set appropriate retention periods for snapshots
5. **Export Regularly**: Export important snapshots for backup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Snapshot Won't Restore**
- Check if all required tabs are accessible
- Verify wallet connections are still valid
- Ensure form data is compatible with current page

**Missing Data After Restore**
- Some data might be privacy-filtered
- Check if the snapshot was created with different privacy settings
- Verify the snapshot wasn't corrupted

**Performance Issues**
- Large snapshots might take time to restore
- Consider creating smaller, more focused snapshots
- Check available storage space
