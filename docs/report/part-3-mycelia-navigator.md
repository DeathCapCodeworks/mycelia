## Part 3, The Mycelia Navigator

### 3.1 Defining Web4

An integrative and user sovereign web that blends the best of Web2 and Web3. Privacy preserving by design and context aware for personalized experiences.

### 3.2 Architectural Layers

Layer 0, Chromium fork considerations and security hardening, engines Blink and V8.

Layer 1, Wallet and protocol integrations, handlers for ipfs://, ar://, and mycelia:// plus EVM and Solana compatibility.

Layer 2, Web4 engine for DIDs, personal data vaults, and libp2p for peer to peer.

Layer 3, UI shell as an OS like workspace with GPU acceleration. Optional transparency window feasibility depends on platform constraints.
