# P-0003: EVM Account Abstraction GA

**Proposal ID**: P-0003  
**Title**: EVM Account Abstraction General Availability  
**Status**: Draft  
**Category**: Experimental Features  

## Motivation

Promote EVM Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) from experimental/pilot status to General Availability, enabling broader adoption of smart account functionality across the Mycelia ecosystem.

## Current State

- EVM Account Abstraction is currently **disabled** via feature flag `evm_aa`
- Pilot program has been running with limited participants
- Core functionality has been validated in testnet environment
- Integration with existing EVM provider is complete

## Proposed Changes

1. **Enable Feature Flag**: Set `evm_aa = true`
2. **Update Documentation**: Publish AA integration guides
3. **Enable Public Access**: Remove pilot restrictions
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track adoption and performance metrics

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Factors
- **New Functionality**: AA is relatively new technology
- **Gas Optimization**: Potential gas cost implications
- **Integration Complexity**: May require dApp updates

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Rollout**: Monitor adoption patterns
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor gas costs and performance
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive integration guides
- **Support**: Dedicated support for early adopters

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. **Immediate**: Disable `evm_aa` flag
2. **Communication**: Notify developers of temporary suspension
3. **Analysis**: Investigate and address root cause
4. **Re-testing**: Additional validation before re-enabling

## Flag Delta

```json
{
  "evm_aa": {
    "from": false,
    "to": true,
    "reason": "Promote AA from experimental to GA after pilot validation"
  }
}
```

## Dry-run Steps

1. **Pilot Completion**: Complete pilot program analysis
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under load
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with popular dApps
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure integration guides are complete

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Complete pilot program analysis
- **Phase 2**: Community vote and approval
- **Phase 3**: GA activation with monitoring
- **Phase 4**: Full documentation and support

## Community Input Required

- Pilot program feedback
- Performance requirements
- Integration priorities
- Support expectations
