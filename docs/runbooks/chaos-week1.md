# Week One Chaos Drill

## Overview

The Week One Chaos Drill is a comprehensive test of the Mycelia system's resilience and emergency response capabilities. This drill simulates various failure scenarios to ensure the system can maintain critical invariants under stress.

## Drill Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Peg Invariant**: Verify the 10 BLOOM = 1 BTC peg remains intact
- **System Resilience**: Test system behavior under stress conditions
- **Emergency Response**: Validate emergency control effectiveness
- **Recovery Procedures**: Test system recovery capabilities

### Secondary Objectives
- **Team Coordination**: Test team response and coordination
- **Communication**: Validate communication procedures
- **Documentation**: Verify runbook effectiveness
- **Monitoring**: Test monitoring and alerting systems

## Drill Scenarios

### Scenario 1: PoR Attestation Stale
**Objective**: Test system response to stale Proof of Reserves attestation

**Steps**:
1. **Simulate PoR Stale**
   - Mark PoR attestation as older than 24 hours
   - Verify system detects staleness

2. **Verify System Response**
   - Check that `release:verify` fails
   - Verify monitoring alerts are triggered
   - Confirm system enters degraded mode

**Expected Results**:
- Release verification fails with clear error message
- Monitoring alerts are triggered
- System continues operating in degraded mode
- Peg invariant remains intact

### Scenario 2: Rewards System Stress
**Objective**: Test rewards system under high load

**Steps**:
1. **Enable Slow Mode**
   ```bash
   mycelia-launchctl slow rewards
   ```

2. **Monitor System Behavior**
   - Check rewards processing rate
   - Verify system stability
   - Monitor resource usage

**Expected Results**:
- Rewards processing slows down
- System remains stable
- Resource usage decreases
- No data corruption or loss

### Scenario 3: Redemption System Failure
**Objective**: Test redemption system emergency controls

**Steps**:
1. **Pause Redemption**
   ```bash
   mycelia-launchctl pause redemption
   ```

2. **Wait Period**
   - Wait 5 minutes (simulated)
   - Monitor system behavior
   - Check user impact

3. **Resume Redemption**
   ```bash
   mycelia-launchctl resume redemption
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Redemption system pauses immediately
- No new redemption requests processed
- Existing requests handled gracefully
- System resumes normally after pause

### Scenario 4: Oracle System Overload
**Objective**: Test Oracle system under resource constraints

**Steps**:
1. **Cap Oracle Read Scope**
   ```bash
   mycelia-launchctl cap oracle 0
   ```

2. **Monitor Oracle Behavior**
   - Check Oracle response times
   - Verify resource usage
   - Test system stability

**Expected Results**:
- Oracle read scope limited
- System remains stable
- No service degradation
- Resource usage controlled

## Drill Execution

   - Check peg invariant status
   - Confirm no data corruption

2. **Team Debrief**
   - Review drill results
   - Identify issues
   - Document lessons learned

3. **Report Generation**
   - Generate signed drill report
   - Document findings
   - Update procedures

## Expected Graphs and Metrics

### Peg Invariant Monitoring

    A[BLOOM Supply] --> B[Peg Check]
    C[Bitcoin Reserves] --> B
    B --> D{Peg Valid?}
    D -->|Yes| E[System Normal]
    D -->|No| F[Emergency Mode]
```

### System Performance Metrics
- **Redemption Queue Length**: Should remain stable during drill
- **PoR Attestation Age**: Should show staleness during drill
- **System Response Time**: Should remain within acceptable limits
- **Error Rates**: Should not increase significantly

### Emergency Control Effectiveness
- **Feature Flag Changes**: Should take effect immediately
- **System Degradation**: Should be graceful and controlled
- **Recovery Time**: Should be within acceptable limits
- **User Impact**: Should be minimal and transparent

## Verification Procedures

### Peg Invariant Verification
```bash
# Check peg status
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/peg/status

# Verify collateralization
pnpm run diagnose | grep "Peg math is exact"

# Check reserve status
mycelia-attest verify ./release/mainnet/por.json
```

### System Health Verification
```bash
# Check system status
curl -f http://localhost:3000/ops/status.json

# Run diagnostics
pnpm run diagnose

# Check SLO compliance
pnpm run ops:lint
```

### Emergency Control Verification
```bash
# Check feature flags
mycelia-flags status

# Verify emergency controls
mycelia-launchctl status

# Check system logs
pnpm run ops:tail
