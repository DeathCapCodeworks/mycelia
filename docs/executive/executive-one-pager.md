# Executive One Pager

Date, October 6, 2025

This one pager presents the vision, pillars, funding context, levers, and near term milestones for Project Mycelia.

## 1. Vision

Convergence of scalable blockchain infrastructure, a minable native asset, and a Web4 browser for a user sovereign web.

## 2. Three Pillars

1. The Mycelia Blockchain, a high performance Layer 1 for scalability, security, and decentralization.
2. The BLOOM Token and Core Applications, a minable native currency with a multi asset wallet and an IPFS native contribution app.
3. The Mycelia Navigator, a Web4 browser that acts as an operating shell for the decentralized web.

### BLOOM Token Peg

The BLOOM token is fixed at a hard peg of 10 BLOOM for 1 BTC. Each BLOOM is fully redeemable for BTC at the fixed rate, backed by locked Bitcoin reserves. Minting halts automatically if reserves would fall below full collateral.

## 3. Funding Context

A foundational component of the Mycelia ecosystem is its substantial financial backing. The project is supported by a treasury of $20,000,000,000 (Twenty Billion USD), secured entirely through cash donations. This capital fully underwrites the project's operational budget, collateralizes its treasury, and guarantees the network's long term financial sovereignty and stability.

## 4. Top Five Strategic Levers

1. Build a secure Layer 1 with strong interop.
2. Prove Proof of Contribution mining at scale.
3. Ship a trusted wallet and contribution client.
4. Launch the Navigator for daily use.
5. Establish research and standards leadership.

## 5. 90 Day Slice

Team formation, architecture baselines, tokenomics draft, wallet and mining prototypes, and Navigator shell.

## 6. 12 Month Headlines

Testnet for Layer 1, wallet GA, mining service active, Navigator beta, partner integrations, and draft standards.
