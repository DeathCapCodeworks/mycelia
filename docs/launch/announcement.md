# ðŸš€ Mycelia Mainnet is Live

We are excited to announce the launch of the Mycelia mainnet, a revolutionary blockchain ecosystem that brings together decentralized applications, a hard-pegged token, and a comprehensive governance framework.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Hard Protocol-Level Peg
**10 BLOOM = 1 BTC** - Each BLOOM token is fully redeemable for Bitcoin at a fixed rate, backed by locked Bitcoin reserves. This peg is enforced programmatically across all system components and cannot be changed without creating a new chain.

### 2. Decentralized Ecosystem
Mycelia provides a complete ecosystem for decentralized applications, including:
- **Oracle Agent**: AI-powered data processing and analysis
- **Social Graph**: Decentralized contact management and permissions
- **Workspaces Engine**: Context-aware application switching
- **Mining Application**: IPFS-based contribution and reward system

### 3. Governance and Treasury
- **Treasury**: $20,000,000,000 (Twenty Billion USD) backed by cash donations
- **Governance v0**: Community-driven decision making with technical oversight
- **Transparent Operations**: All decisions and financial transactions are public

## Proof of Reserves

Our Bitcoin reserves are continuously verified through:
- **SPV Verification**: Simplified Payment Verification of Bitcoin UTXOs
- **Regular Attestations**: Cryptographically signed reserve snapshots
- **Public Transparency**: Real-time reserve status and verification

## Governance Framework

Mycelia operates under a transparent governance model:
- **Community Council**: Elected community representatives
- **Technical Committee**: Protocol development and security oversight
- **Treasury Committee**: Financial management and audit compliance
